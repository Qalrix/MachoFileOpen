# MachoFileOpen

This open-source tool allows you to analyze Mach-O formats including .bin and .exe also.

# Which framework did it use?

PyQt5.

# Does it generate pseudocode?

Unfortunately, the pseudocode is an example for MachoFileOpen and I'll need to add third-party tools into the codes.

# Follow me for more updates.
